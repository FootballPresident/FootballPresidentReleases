## Changelog
- New User Interface: the app looks a bit slicker, the menu bar has been re-designed.
- Full database on the game servers — that includes 7 nations, 19 leagues and 392 teams running on 5 different servers. Each server will run at a different speed so we can test what the optimal speed is!

- Message Interface in a similar old school Championship Manager style so you can keep up to date on what’s happening in the game world.
- You can browse through the Game World, Continents, Nations and Competitions screen (league only at the moment!)
- Entire seasons will be generated, including fixture creation, match results, promotions and relegations etc.
- Character creation bug fixed!
- My profile screen added!
